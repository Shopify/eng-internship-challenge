# Solution  
This solution decrypts the **"IKEWENENXLNQLPZSLERUMRHEERYBOFNEINCHCV"** message with the **"SUPERSPY"** key by reversing the Playfair Cipher.

The main program generates a key table, decrypts the message and prints it at the end.

Credits: The decryption and key table are built based on the Playfair Cipher [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher).
