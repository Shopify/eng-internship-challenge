Attention, HQ!

I have completed the assignment of decrypting this most important message. Please run my completed program as previously instructed to obtain the decrypted message.

I cannot say much for fear of giving away too much information. But I hope you all are not afraid of long words!

Thank you for your time! I hope this message reaches the right people, and best of luck infiltrating 32nd Street, and the Spy City spy club.

I look forward to hearing further updates from you all again soon!
